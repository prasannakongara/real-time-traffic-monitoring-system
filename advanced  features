Advanced Features
For a more advanced traffic monitoring system, you might consider:

- Object detection: Use machine learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Detector) to detect vehicles, pedestrians, or other objects in the video feed.
- Tracking: Implement object tracking algorithms to follow the movement of detected objects across frames.
- Traffic analysis: Analyze traffic patterns, such as speed, density, or flow, to provide insights for traffic management.

These features would require more complex code and potentially additional libraries or frameworks.

additinal information
- Traffic congestion monitoring: Use the system to monitor traffic congestion in real-time and provide updates to drivers or traffic management authorities.
- Accident detection: Implement algorithms to detect accidents or incidents on the road and alert emergency services or traffic authorities.
- Traffic signal control: Use the system to optimize traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow
