Real-Time Traffic Monitoring System
Creating a comprehensive real-time traffic monitoring system requires a complex setup involving various technologies like sensors, cameras, GPS, and data analytics. However, I can provide a basic example of how you might structure a simple traffic monitoring system using Python and OpenCV for video processing.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)
- A webcam or camera to capture video feed
project executable files
Release the camera and close all windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Explanation
1. Capture video feed from a camera using OpenCV's VideoCapture function.
2. Convert each frame to grayscale and apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
3. Use Canny edge detection to detect edges in the frame, which can help identify vehicles or other objects.
4. Display the resulting frame using imshow.
5. Release the camera and close all windows when done
